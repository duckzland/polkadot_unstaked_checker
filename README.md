Script for checking the value of unbonding stake between "eras" at Polkadot network

Notice: this is for educational purposes only, the result might not be correct!. I have no extensive knowledge about Polkadot Network thus cannot check and verify if the returned results of this code reflect the actual condition of unbonding state.


Need proper nodejs installed at your system, then invoke

```
npm install
```

to download and install the required dependencies.


You can invoke it afterwards by running:

```
npm run execute
```

or directly via node

```
node index.js
```

Binary file for Linux and Windows is located at /dist folder

If you wish to bundle it your self, you need the https://github.com/vercel/pkg package.

```
npm install -g pkg
```

then build it by invoking:

```
npm run build
```
